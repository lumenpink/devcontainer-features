# bun (bun)

Add bun, the all-in-one javascript runtime, using the installer (and keeping the .bun/bin on path)

## Example Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/lumenpink/devcontainer-features/bun:0": {}
}
```



# About

ItÂ´s the same old boring bun installer through the script on their site.
The only difference is that this install adds the ~/.bun/bin dir to the PATH variable making it easier to run globally installed scripts.
